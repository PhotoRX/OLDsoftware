## PCC_V4.h
This header file appears to define the necessary constants, macros, and function prototypes used across the main program. It may include pin configurations, sensor settings, and communication protocols.

 ### Key Components:
#### Pin Definitions: It likely defines which pins are connected to specific hardware components like sensors, DACs, or ADCs.
#### Function Prototypes: These would declare key functions that will be used in the main .ino file.
#### Configuration Constants: Thresholds, operational modes, gain values, etc., are defined for the DAC/ADC operations.

## PCC_V4.ino
This is one of the main program files where the setup and loop functions are defined for the Arduino.

### Key Sections:
#### Setup Function:

Initializes I2C communication, sets pin modes, and prepares the hardware for operation.
#### Loop Function:

Contains the main logic that runs repeatedly. This likely includes reading sensor values, processing inputs, and controlling outputs based on those values.
#### Peripheral Functions:

Includes functions for DAC and ADC setup, temperature sensor management, and I2C scanning.
#### Error Handling:

Handles errors, such as failures to detect I2C devices or temperature sensors.


## JJ_ADS1x15.h
This header file likely contains the implementation for interacting with the ADS1x15 ADC over I2C. It would define how to configure the ADC (gain, data rate, mode), and how to request data from specific channels.

### Key Functions:
setGain(): Sets the input range of the ADC.
setDataRate(): Configures the speed at which the ADC samples data.
requestADC(): Starts a conversion on a specific channel and retrieves the result.

## JJ_MCP4728.h
This file is likely used to control the MCP4728 DAC over I2C. It would include functions to set the output voltage of the DAC channels and configure them as needed.

### Key Functions:
analogWrite(): Writes a value to a DAC channel.
enable(): Enables or disables the DAC output.

## PCC_Co.ino
This file could represent a specific mode or configuration of the program. It may be responsible for performing a particular task like calibrating sensors or conducting a test on a specific hardware component.

## PCC_Test.ino
This seems to be a test file, used to verify that the hardware components (ADC, DAC, temperature sensors) are functioning correctly. It likely includes functions to run through test scenarios, print out results, and check sensor values.

### Key Sections:
#### Test Function:
Conducts tests on each component (e.g., scans I2C devices, checks ADC/DAC functionality, verifies temperature sensors).
#### Output Formatting:
Uses sprintf_P to format and print test results to the serial monitor.

## PCC_Trabajo.ino
This file seems to be focused on performing the actual work for the project. It may involve a specific operational mode where the ADC and DAC are continuously interacting, based on sensor readings.

### Key Sections:
#### Control Loops:
Contains the logic to continuously manage DAC and ADC values in real time, processing inputs and outputs as needed.
#### Data Logging or Display:
May also include functionality for logging data or displaying it on an external display or via serial communication.
